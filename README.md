# KovaakShuffler
> An External tool for shuffling Kovaak's 2.0 (FPSAimTrainer) Playlists

As of right now (17/08/2020) Kovaak does not support a shuffle option in their playlists. So I wrote a small program that can help you shuffling your playlist.
Credits to [13xforever](https://github.com/13xforever/gvas-converter) as I used most of his code to read the save file.
